# ReactJS Pizza Application üçï

## Motivation

This Pizza Menu project is a ReactJS based application, developed as part of my journey to master and solidfy basic [React](https://react.dev/) concepts, such as _components_ and _props_. It marks my first application in a series of development projects inspired by the Udemy course [The Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course).

Additionally, this project serves to solidify the foundational knowledge I acquired by completing the official [React](https://react.dev/) documentation's under [Learn section](https://react.dev/learn).

This project combines theory with practice, aiming to build a solid foundation for more complex React applications in the future.

## Features ‚ú®

1. [**ReactJS**](https://react.dev/) - v18.3;
2. **CSS Modules** - Used for styling individual components;
3. **JavaScript (ES6)** - Utilized modern JavaScript features such as array methods, template literals, and destructuring for cleaner and more efficient code.

### Component Structure üõ†Ô∏è

All components are located under the `App.jsx` file. This decision was intentional, allowing everything to remain in one place for easier tracking of changes during the development process. It simplified the focus on core concepts such as:

- Implementing **props** to pass data between components.
- Structuring reusable **components** for modular design.
- Using **conditional rendering** to dynamically display content based on application state.
- Traversing arrays efficiently using **map** and other ES6 array methods.
- Leveraging **ternary operators** for concise conditional logic within JSX.

This structure prioritizes simplicity and focus while solidifying key React fundamentals.
